# Systems Engineering

This section documents the design, deployment, and operation of technical
systems that support experimental and applied work within the Open Physics Lab.

The focus lies on building reliable, observable, and reproducible infrastructure
for data acquisition, control, automation, and long-term system operation.

---

## Scope

This area covers computational and operational systems that connect physical
experiments with data processing, monitoring, and control environments.

Topics include service orchestration, automation workflows, data pipelines, and
deployment architectures.

---

## Core Areas of Interest

- Docker-based service stacks  
- Proxmox virtualization and deployment patterns  
- Node-RED workflows and automation logic  
- system monitoring and observability  
- data storage and time-series processing  

---

## Engineering Directions

Current and ongoing work includes:

- development of modular Docker service environments  
- reproducible deployment of experimental infrastructure  
- integration of automation workflows with physical systems  
- logging, monitoring, and fault analysis for long-running systems  

Concrete implementations and configurations are documented in the corresponding
project repositories referenced in **[PROJECTS.md](../PROJECTS.md)**.

## Methodological Principles

- infrastructure as code  
- reproducible deployment and configuration  
- explicit documentation of system behavior  
- gradual refinement through operational feedback
