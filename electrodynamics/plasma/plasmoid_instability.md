# Plasmoid Instability

The plasmoid instability is a tearing-type instability of thin current
sheets that occurs at sufficiently high Lundquist number. It radically
changes the nature of magnetic reconnection in high-conductivity plasmas.

This instability is central to modern reconnection theory and to the work
of Loureiro, Uzdensky, and collaborators.

## 1) Why Sweet–Parker Fails at High \(S\)

In the classical Sweet–Parker model, the current sheet thickness is

\[
\delta_{SP} \sim L S^{-1/2}
\]

As \(S\) increases, the sheet becomes extremely long and thin.

However, such thin sheets become unstable before they can reach steady state.

## 2) Linear Plasmoid Instability

Loureiro et al. showed that a Sweet–Parker current sheet becomes unstable
when

\[
S \gtrsim S_c \sim 10^4
\]

The fastest-growing mode has growth rate

\[
\gamma_{\max} \sim \frac{V_A}{L} S^{1/4}
\]

and produces many magnetic islands ("plasmoids") along the sheet.

This growth rate **increases with \(S\)** — unlike classical tearing modes.

## 3) Nonlinear Development

Once plasmoids form:

- the original current sheet fragments
- secondary current sheets appear between plasmoids
- reconnection becomes **time-dependent and bursty**
- the global reconnection rate becomes **weakly dependent on \(S\)**

This leads to **fast reconnection**, consistent with observations in both
laboratory and astrophysical plasmas.

## 4) Hierarchical Structure

At very large \(S\), the process becomes hierarchical:

current sheet → plasmoids → secondary sheets → secondary plasmoids → ...

This creates a statistical steady state of reconnection dominated by
plasmoid dynamics.

## 5) Physical Consequences

- Fast energy release
- Strong particle acceleration
- Enhanced transport and turbulence
- Formation of complex magnetic topology

These effects are crucial in:
- tokamak disruptions
- solar flares
- magnetospheric substorms
- astrophysical jets

## 6) Conceptual Shift

The plasmoid instability replaced the idea of a single smooth current sheet
with a dynamic, multiscale reconnection region.

This is one of the major paradigm shifts in plasma physics of the last two decades.
