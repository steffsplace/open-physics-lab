# Miscellaneous References

This folder collects selected scientific works that do not fall strictly into
historical foundations or core project documentation, but are relevant for
broadening perspective on **fields, interfaces, and physical systems**.

The emphasis is on peer-reviewed or institutional research that raises
interesting questions while remaining grounded in experimental observation.

## Elmar C. Fuchs

Elmar C. Fuchs is a physicist whose work spans optics, water physics,
interfacial phenomena, and unconventional experimental conditions.
Several of his publications are relevant to themes explored in this repository,
particularly regarding **surface effects, environmental fields, and measurement sensitivity**.

### Solar Eclipses and the Surface Properties of Water  
**Fuchs et al., 2019**

- Authors: Elmar C. Fuchs et al.
- Year: 2019
- Institution: Wetsus – European Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Water Technology
- Status: Publicly available PDF
- Link:  
  https://www.wetsus.nl/app/uploads/2019/12/Solar-Eclipses-and-the-Surface-Properties-of-Water.pdf

**Why this is interesting here:**
- Investigates changes in water surface properties correlated with solar eclipses
- Focuses on measurable interfacial effects rather than speculative mechanisms
- Highlights how subtle environmental conditions may influence physical systems
- Relevant to:
  - surface physics
  - boundary layers
  - sensitivity of experimental setups
  - caution in interpreting low-signal phenomena

This work is included as an example of how **careful experimentation at interfaces**
can reveal unexpected correlations, while still demanding rigorous skepticism.
