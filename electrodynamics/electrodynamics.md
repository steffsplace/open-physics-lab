# Electrodynamics — Notes & Directions

This document collects conceptual notes, experimental directions, and references
related to the study of electrodynamics within the Open Physics Lab.

The emphasis lies on understanding field behavior in real systems through
measurement, controlled experiments, and clear physical modeling.

## Scope

This section focuses on classical electrodynamics and experimentally accessible
field phenomena.  
Quantum and purely theoretical treatments are intentionally outside the scope
of this document unless they directly inform measurement or system design.

---

## Core Areas of Interest

- coil geometry and electromagnetic coupling  
- resonance phenomena and frequency response  
- measurement techniques and probe interaction effects  
- field confinement and field geometry  
- energy transfer and loss mechanisms  

---

## Experimental Directions

Current and planned experimental work includes:

- investigation of coupled resonant systems  
- influence of geometry on field distribution  
- high-frequency measurement techniques  
- interaction between fields and conductive structures  

Detailed experimental records and implementations are maintained in the
corresponding project repositories referenced in **[PROJECTS.md](../PROJECTS.md)**.

---

## Methodological Principles

- classical field theory as the primary framework  
- careful separation of observation and interpretation  
- reproducible measurement setups  
- explicit treatment of measurement uncertainty

## Open Questions

This document will evolve as experiments progress.  
Unresolved questions and emerging directions are documented here as they arise.
