# Magnetic Reconnection

Magnetic reconnection is the process by which magnetic field topology changes
in a plasma, allowing stored magnetic energy to be rapidly converted into
kinetic energy, heat, and particle acceleration.

It is fundamental to both laboratory plasmas and astrophysical systems.

## 1) Basic Picture

In ideal MHD, magnetic field lines are frozen into the plasma.
Finite resistivity breaks this constraint in localized regions, allowing
field lines to reconnect.

Reconnection requires:
- a thin current sheet
- non-ideal effects (resistivity, Hall physics, kinetic effects)

## 2) Sweet–Parker Model

Classical steady-state reconnection model:

- long, thin current sheet of length \(L\) and thickness \(\delta\)
- inflow velocity \(v_{in}\)
- outflow velocity \(\sim V_A\)

Scaling:

\[
\delta \sim L S^{-1/2}
\quad,\quad
v_{in} \sim V_A S^{-1/2}
\]

For large \(S\), reconnection becomes extremely slow.

## 3) Petschek Model (Conceptual)

Petschek proposed a configuration with standing slow-mode shocks that
allows much faster reconnection.

However, for uniform resistivity this configuration is typically unstable,
and systems tend to revert to Sweet–Parker–like layers.

## 4) Transition to Fast Reconnection

At sufficiently high \(S\), the Sweet–Parker sheet becomes unstable to the
plasmoid instability.

This leads to:
- fragmentation of the current sheet
- multiple reconnection sites
- fast, bursty reconnection

The global reconnection rate becomes weakly dependent on \(S\).

## 5) Beyond Resistive MHD

In many systems, additional physics becomes important:

- Hall effect
- electron pressure te
