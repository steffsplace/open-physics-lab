# Electrodynamics — Notes & Directions

This section collects notes, experiment ideas, and references related to
electrodynamics.

Initial areas of interest:
- coil geometry and coupling
- resonance and frequency response
- measurement techniques and probe effects
- field confinement and geometry

This document will evolve as experiments are added.
