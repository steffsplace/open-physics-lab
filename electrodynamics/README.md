# Electrodynamics

This section collects structured notes, models, and research-oriented material on  
**electrodynamics, superconducting devices, plasma physics, and fusion-related phenomena**.

The goal is to bridge **theory, computation, and experimental practice**, with emphasis on
systems where electromagnetic fields dominate the dynamics:  
superconductors, SQUID sensors, magnetized plasmas, and high-energy laboratory devices.

The content reflects both academic study and hands-on experimental and engineering work,
including historical laboratory experiments conducted at the  
**Interstaatliche Hochschule für Technik NTB (1991)** on **SQUID-based measurements in cryogenic helium environments**.

These experiments included:

- operation of SQUID sensors in liquid helium
- spectral analysis of environmental magnetic signals
- detection of large-scale infrastructure activity (e.g. electric train power draw)
- magnetocardiography measurements of biological magnetic fields

Associated documentation and recovered data will be integrated into the structure below
as archival and reproducible experimental material.

## Scope & Philosophy

This directory is intended as a long-term knowledge base connecting:

- electromagnetic theory
- computational models
- laboratory instrumentation
- cryogenic and superconducting systems
- plasma and fusion-related electrodynamics

It serves both as a research notebook and as an educational resource for students and collaborators.

## Historical Experiment Archive (planned)

The `squid/experiments_1991.md` file will document:

- cryogenic setup and instrumentation
- SQUID operating conditions
- spectral measurement methods
- observed environmental and biological magnetic signals
- recovered plots, tables, and photographs (when available)

This archive will preserve original experimental work while making it accessible for
modern analysis and educational use.

## Long-Term Vision

This section is designed to grow into a complete electrodynamics research environment,
combining:

- theoretical derivations
- simulation models
- experimental protocols
- real measurement data

It forms one of the core scientific pillars of the **Open Physics Lab**.
