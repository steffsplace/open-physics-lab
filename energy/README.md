# Energy Systems

This section documents applied energy management and automation work within the
Open Physics Lab.  
The focus lies on real-world energy systems, their measurement, control, and
integration into larger technical environments.

Much of the work in this area is developed together with students as part of
teaching, engineering projects, and long-term experimental studies.

## Scope

This area covers practical energy systems and their interaction with physical,
electrical, and computational infrastructure.

Topics include building-level energy management, thermal systems, electrical
distribution, and integration with automation platforms.

---

## Core Areas of Interest

- heating control and thermal regulation  
- building automation and KNX integration  
- solar power generation and monitoring  
- electrical energy distribution and measurement  
- charging infrastructure and load management  

---

## Experimental & Engineering Directions

Current and planned work includes:

- development of networked heating controllers  
- integration of KNX-based building systems  
- monitoring and optimization of solar power production  
- charging station management and energy balancing  
- data-driven analysis of consumption patterns  

Related implementations and system designs are documented in the corresponding
project repositories referenced in **[PROJECTS.md](../PROJECTS.md)**.
