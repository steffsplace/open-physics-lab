# Electrodynamics

This folder collects structured notes, models, and research-oriented material on  
**electrodynamics, superconducting devices, plasma physics, and fusion-related phenomena**.

The goal is to bridge **theory, computation, and experimental practice**, with emphasis on
systems where electromagnetic fields dominate the dynamics:  
superconductors, SQUID sensors, magnetized plasmas, and high-energy laboratory devices.

The content here reflects both academic study and hands-on engineering interests.
