# Systems Engineering

This section documents the design, deployment, and operation of technical
systems that support experimental and applied work within the Open Physics Lab.

The focus lies on building reliable, observable, and reproducible infrastructure
for data acquisition, control, automation, and long-term system operation.

---

## Scope

This area covers computational and operational systems that connect physical
experiments with data processing, monitoring, and control environments.

Topics include service orchestration, automation workflows, data pipelines, and
deployment architectures.

---

## Core Areas of Interest

- Docker-based service stacks  
- Proxmox virtualization and deployment patterns  
- Node-RED workflows and automation logic  
- system monitoring and observability  
- data storage and time-series processing  

---

## Engineering Directions

Current and ongoing work includes:

- development of modular Docker service environments  
- reproducible deployment of experimental infrastructure  
- integration of automation workflows with physical systems  
- logging, monitoring, and fault analysis for long-running systems  

Concrete implementations and configurations are documented in the corresponding
project repositories referenced in **[PROJECTS.md](../PROJECTS.md)**.

---

## Methodological Principles

- infrastructure as code  
- reproducible deployment and configuration  
- explicit documentation of system behavior  
- gradual refinement through operational feedback

## System Architecture Overview

The current control and automation infrastructure is organized as a layered system.

### Embedded Control Layer

Low-level real-time control implemented on dedicated hardware.

- Microcontroller: **Portenta H7**
- Language: **C++**
- Responsibilities:
  - sensor acquisition
  - actuator control
  - real-time regulation
  - MQTT communication

Repository:
- Firmware / controller:  
  https://github.com/steffsplace/HeatingController_MQTT

### Automation & Interface Layer

Higher-level orchestration, visualization, and automation.

- Platform: **Node-RED**
- Deployment targets:
  - **Raspberry Pi**
  - **Proxmox virtual machines**
- Responsibilities:
  - system supervision
  - data aggregation and logging
  - user interface and dashboards
  - automation workflows
  - integration with energy and building systems

Repository:
- Automation / UI:  
  https://github.com/steffsplace/HeatingController_NodeRED

---

### Infrastructure Layer

Supporting environment for running distributed services.

- Docker-based services
- Proxmox virtualization
- Network services and monitoring
- Backup and deployment tooling

This layer enables flexible deployment of control, automation, and experimental
services across physical and virtual hardware.

---

## Design Principles (Applied)

- clear separation of control and automation responsibilities  
- reproducible deployments  
- observable systems (logging, monitoring, metrics)  
- incremental evolution of infrastructure
