# Open Physics Lab

An open and collaborative workspace for applied and experimental physics, 
systems engineering, and the study of physical flow systems.

This repository serves as the entry point to my work as an independent college 
educator (GBS SG), together with projects developed with students and collaborators.

The focus lies on understanding, building, measuring, and documenting real physical 
and technical systems — from field theory and electrodynamics to automation, 
energy systems, and computational infrastructure.

Developed and maintained by
Stefan Eberle — Senior Systems Engineer & Technical Educator

## Core Themes

### 🔬 Electrodynamics (primary focus)
Field geometry, coupling, resonance, and measurement.
Experimental work, instrumentation practice, and theoretical foundations.

### 🌪️ Vortex & Flow Systems
Vortex dynamics, fluid mechanics, and the study of physical transport processes.

### ⚡ Energy & Automation
Heating control, KNX integration, solar power management, and charging infrastructure.

### 🧰 Systems Engineering
Docker-based services, Node-RED flows, Proxmox deployment patterns, and operational infrastructure.
