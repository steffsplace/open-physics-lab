# Fusion Context

This file connects magnetic reconnection and plasma electrodynamics
to practical fusion devices and their operational challenges.

## 1) Why Electrodynamics Dominates Fusion Plasmas

In magnetic confinement fusion devices (tokamaks, stellarators),
the plasma is:

- extremely hot
- highly conductive
- strongly magnetized

This places the plasma deep in the **high-Lundquist-number regime**:

\[
S \sim 10^6 - 10^{12}
\]

Electrodynamic effects therefore dominate transport, stability, and energy release.

## 2) Current Sheets in Fusion Devices

Current sheets naturally form during:

- sawtooth crashes
- edge localized modes (ELMs)
- major disruptions
- magnetic island evolution

Their stability and evolution are controlled by the same physics
described in `magnetic_reconnection.md` and `plasmoid_instability.md`.

## 3) Disruptions and Fast Reconnection

During disruptions:

- large-scale current sheets appear
- reconnection becomes rapid and violent
- magnetic energy is converted into heat and runaway electrons

Plasmoid-mediated reconnection is believed to play a key role
in the rapid timescales observed in experiments.

## 4) Transport and Confinement

Magnetic turbulence and reconnection affect:

- energy confinement time
- particle transport
- impurity accumulation

These processes limit the achievable plasma performance and determine
whether sustained fusion conditions are possible.

## 5) Control and Prediction

Understanding reconnection and current-sheet physics allows:

- improved disruption prediction
- mitigation strategies (massive gas injection, shattered pellets)
- optimized confinement regimes

This is a central research topic for modern fusion programs
(ITER, SPARC, DEMO).

## 6) Conceptual Picture

Fusion performance is governed by a delicate balance:

magnetic confinement ↔ turbulence ↔ reconnection ↔ transport ↔ stability

Electrodynamics provides the unifying language for this balance.

## Final Perspective

From SQUIDs measuring fT-scale magnetic fields to plasmoid chains releasing
gigajoules of magnetic energy in tokamaks, the same physical principles apply.

This unification is what makes electrodynamics such a powerful framework
for both instrumentation and fusion science.
