# Fields & Flows

This repository is the entry point to my work as an independent college educator (GBS SG)
exploring **electrodynamics, physical flow systems, and control software**.

My primary interest is **electrodynamics** — field geometry, coupling, resonance,
and measurement — alongside **vortex-driven flow systems** and the software
infrastructure required to run, control, and observe real systems.

The common theme across all projects is **flow**:
- flow of energy
- flow of information
- flow of physical media

## Areas of work
- Electrodynamics (primary focus)
- Vortex and fluid mechanics
- Energy management and automation
- Control and systems engineering (Docker, Node-RED, Proxmox)

This repository serves as:
- an index to projects
- a roadmap for future work
- a reference for collaboration

See [PROJECTS.md](./PROJECTS.md) for details.
