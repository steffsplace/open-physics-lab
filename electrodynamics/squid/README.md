# SQUID Systems

This section documents theoretical foundations, experimental practice, and historical
research related to **Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs)**.

SQUIDs are among the most sensitive magnetic field detectors ever built and play a central
role in experimental physics, biomedical sensing, geophysics, and fundamental research.

This directory combines formal theory with real laboratory experience.

## Historical Laboratory Work — NTB (1991)

During physics studies at the  
**Interstaatliche Hochschule für Technik NTB (1991)**, extensive laboratory experiments were
performed on SQUID-based measurement systems under cryogenic conditions.

Key elements of this work included:

- operation of SQUID sensors in **liquid helium**
- development and tuning of cryogenic measurement setups
- use of **spectrum analyzers** for magnetic signal detection
- observation of large-scale environmental magnetic effects  
  (e.g. electrical railway power draw)
- execution of **magnetocardiography measurements** of biological magnetic fields

The original notebooks, plots, and reports from this period are currently being recovered
and will be integrated here as part of a reproducible experimental archive.
