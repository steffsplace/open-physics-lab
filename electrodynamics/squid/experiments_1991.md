# SQUID Experiments — NTB 1991

This document collects experimental work performed in 1991 at the  
**Interstaatliche Hochschule für Technik NTB** in the field of superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID) measurement systems.

The experiments were conducted in a cryogenic laboratory environment using
liquid helium and ultra-sensitive magnetic sensing instrumentation.

## Laboratory Environment

**Location:** NTB (Interstaatliche Hochschule für Technik)  
**Year:** 1991  
**Temperature range:** Cryogenic (liquid helium)

## Experiment Categories

### 1. Cryogenic SQUID Characterization

- sensor biasing and tuning
- noise floor measurements
- sensitivity optimization
- flux–voltage response analysis
- thermal stability behavior

---

### 2. Environmental Magnetic Field Observation

Unexpectedly strong magnetic signatures were observed originating from
large-scale infrastructure:

- detection of magnetic activity correlated with **electric railway power draw**
- time-domain analysis of magnetic fluctuations
- spectral decomposition of environmental interference

These measurements demonstrated the extreme sensitivity of SQUID systems
even in non-ideal laboratory conditions.

### 3. Magnetocardiography (MCG)

Biomagnetic measurements of cardiac activity were performed using SQUID sensors.

- detection of weak magnetic fields generated by the human heart
- comparison with simultaneous ECG measurements
- noise reduction and shielding techniques
- spectral analysis of cardiac magnetic signals

This work demonstrated the potential of SQUID systems for medical diagnostics.
