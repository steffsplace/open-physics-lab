# Projects

This document provides an overview of ongoing and planned work within the
Open Physics Lab. It acts as a central index to concrete projects, experimental
activities, and system implementations.

Project descriptions are intentionally concise here; detailed documentation
is maintained within the corresponding discipline directories and individual
project repositories.
