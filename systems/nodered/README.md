# Node-RED

This folder contains Node-RED infrastructure notes and shared conventions.

## Scope

- Node-RED runtime configuration (Docker/Portainer)
- common node sets and dependencies
- flow export conventions (how we version flows)
- small smoke tests / examples

Project-specific flows belong into their own repositories.
